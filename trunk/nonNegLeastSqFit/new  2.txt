1.My thesis topic is about a general framework to publish motion sensor as a HTTP based web service.

2.So this is the outline of today's talk: 
I will start with an introduction about motion sensor and the idea of motion sensor based web service.
Then I'll discuss about the problems I'm trying to solve in designing such a framework.
After I'll briefly go over the literatures I reviewed for this work.
Finally I'll present my design of the framework and the experiments I'm going to conduct to evaluate its performance.

3.So first of all, what is motion sensor? motion sensor normally refers devices that can sense the motion.
 The motion sensor my research targeted at is actually a special case that is composed by two key components:
 One is a range camera to capture the depth information in its view volume, and the other a color camera to capture the color information in its view volume.
 Those two kinds of data will later go through a human posture recognition pipeline to generate an abstraction of human body in 3D space, 
 usually in the form of skeleton
